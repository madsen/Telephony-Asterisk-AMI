=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Telephony::Asterisk::AMI depends on L<IO::Socket::IP>, which became a
core module with Perl 5.20.  There are no other non-core dependencies.

=cut

use Carp ();
use IO::Socket::IP ();

our $VERSION = '0.003';
# This file is part of {{$dist}} {{$dist_version}} ({{$date}})

#=====================================================================

=method-construct new

  $ami = Telephony::Asterisk::AMI->new(%args);

Constructs a new C<$ami> object.  The C<%args> may be passed as a
hashref or a list of S<C<< key => value >>> pairs.

This does not do any network communication; you must call L</connect>
to open the connection before doing anything else.

The parameters are:

=over

=item C<Username>

The AMI username to use when logging in. (required)

=item C<Secret>

The AMI secret (password) to use when logging in. (required)

=item C<Host>

The hostname to connect to.
You can also specify C<hostname:port> as a single string.
(default: localhost).

=item C<Port>

The port number to connect to (if no port was specified with C<Host>).
(default: 5038)

=item C<ActionID>

The ActionID to start at.  Each call to L</action> increments the ActionID.
(Note: The L</connect> & L</disconnect> methods also consume an ActionID for
the implicit Login & Logoff actions.)
(default: 1)

=item C<Debug>

If set to a true value, sets C<Debug_FH> to C<STDERR>
(unless it was already set to a different value).
(default: false)

=item C<Debug_FH>

A filehandle to write a transcript of the communications to.
Lines sent to Asterisk are prefixed with C<<< >> >>>, and lines
received from Asterisk are prefixed with C<<< << >>>.
(default: no transcript)

=item C<Event_Callback>

A coderef that is called when an event is received from Asterisk while
the L</action> method is waiting for a response.  The event data is
passed as a hashref, just like the return value of the C<action>
method.  You MUST NOT call any methods on C<$ami> from inside the
callback.
(default: events are ignored)

=back

The constructor throws an exception if a required parameter is
omitted.

=diag C<Required parameter %s not defined>

You omitted a required parameter from a method call.

=cut

sub new {
  my $class = shift;
  my $args = (@_ == 1) ? shift : { @_ };

  my $self = bless {
    Debug_FH => ($args->{Debug_FH} || ($args->{Debug} ? *STDERR : undef)),
    Event_Callback => $args->{Event_Callback},
    Host => $args->{Host} || 'localhost',
    Port => $args->{Port} || 5038,
    ActionID => $args->{ActionID} || 1,
  }, $class;

  for my $key (qw(Username Secret)) {
    defined( $self->{$key} = $args->{$key} )
        or Carp::croak("Required parameter '$key' not defined");
  }

  $self;
} # end new
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method-main connect

  $success = $ami->connect;

Opens the connection to Asterisk and logs in.
C<$success> is true if the login was successful, or C<undef> on error.
On failure, you can get the error message with C<< $ami->error >>.

=cut

sub connect {
  my $self = shift;

  # Open a socket to Asterisk.
  #   IO::Socket::IP->new reports error in $@
  local $@;

  $self->{socket} = IO::Socket::IP->new(
    Type => IO::Socket::IP::SOCK_STREAM(),
    PeerHost => $self->{Host},
    PeerService => $self->{Port},
  );

  unless ($self->{socket}) {
    $self->{error} = "Connection failed: $@";
    return undef;
  }

  # Verify that we've connected to Asterisk Call Manager
  my $id = readline($self->{socket});

  unless (defined $id) {
    $self->{error} = "Connection closed without input: $!";
    undef $self->{socket};
    return undef;
  }

  chomp $id;
  print { $self->{Debug_FH} } "<< $id\n" if $self->{Debug_FH};

  if ($id =~ m!^Asterisk Call Manager/(.+)!) {
    $self->{protocol} = $1;
  } else {
    $self->{error} = "Unknown Protocol";
    undef $self->{socket};
    return undef;
  }

  # Automatically log in using Username/Secret
  my $response = $self->action({
    Action => 'Login',
    Username => $self->{Username},
    Secret => $self->{Secret},
  });

  # If login failed, set error
  unless ($response->{Response} eq 'Success') {
    $self->{error} = "Login failed: $response->{Message}";
    undef $self->{socket};
    return undef;
  }

  # Login successful
  1;
} # end connect
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method-main disconnect

  $success = $ami->disconnect;

Logs off of Asterisk and closes the connection.
C<$success> is true if the logoff was successful, or C<undef> on error.
On failure, you can get the error message with C<< $ami->error >>.

After a successful call to C<disconnect>, you may call C<connect>
again to reestablish the connection.

=cut

sub disconnect {
  my $self = shift;

  my $response = $self->action({Action => 'Logoff'});

  # If logoff failed, set error
  unless ($response->{Response} eq 'Goodbye') {
    $self->{error} = "Logoff failed: $response->{Message}";
    undef $self->{socket};
    return undef;
  }

  unless ($self->{socket}->close) {
    $self->{error} = "Closing socket failed: $!";
    undef $self->{socket};
    return undef;
  }

  undef $self->{socket};

  # Logoff successful
  1;
} # end disconnect
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method-main action

  $response = $ami->action(%args);

Sends an action request to Asterisk and returns the response.  The
C<%args> may be passed as a hashref or a list of S<C<< key => value
>>> pairs, where the keys are the Asterisk field names.  To create
more than one instance of a field, make the value an arrayref.

The only required key is C<Action>.  (Asterisk may require other keys
depending on the value of C<Action>, but that is not enforced by this
module.)

Do not pass an C<ActionID> in C<%args>.  The ActionID is provided
automatically.

The C<$response> is a hashref formed from Asterisk's response in the
same format as C<%args>.  It will have a C<Response> key whose value
is either C<Success> or C<Error>.  Unless it's an error response, it
will also have an C<ActionID> key whose value is the ActionID assigned
to it.  (An error response might or might not have an ActionID.)

Any events that are received while waiting for the response to the
action are dispatched to the C<Event_Callback> (if any).  If no
callback was provided, events are discarded.

If you have not called the C<connect> method (or it failed), calling
C<action> will return a manufactured Error response with Message
"Not connected to Asterisk!" and set C<< $ami->error >>.

If communication with Asterisk fails, it will return a manufactured
Error response with Message "Writing to socket failed: %s" or
"Reading from socket failed: %s" and set C<< $ami->error >>.

=cut

sub action {
  my $self = shift;

  # Send the request to Asterisk
  my $id = $self->send_action(@_) or return {
    Response => 'Error',
    Message => $self->{error},
  };

  # Read responses until we get the response to this action
  while (1) {
    my $response = $self->read_response;

    # If this is the response to the action we just sent,
    # or there was an error, return it.
    no warnings 'uninitialized';
    if (($response->{ActionID} eq $id) ||
        ($response->{Response} eq 'Error')) {
      return $response;
    }

    # If there is an event callback, send it this event
    if ($self->{Event_Callback}) {
      $self->{Event_Callback}->($response);
    }
  } # end infinite loop waiting for response
} # end action
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method-low send_action

  $actionid = $ami->send_action(%args);

Sends an action request to Asterisk and returns the ActionID.  The
C<%args> are the same as for L</action>.

Do not pass an C<ActionID> in C<%args>.  The ActionID is provided
automatically and returned.

If you have not called the C<connect> method (or it failed), calling
C<send_action> will return C<undef> and set C<< $ami->error >> to
"Not connected to Asterisk!".

If communication with Asterisk fails, it will return C<undef> and set
C<< $ami->error >> to "Writing to socket failed: %s".

=cut

sub send_action {
  my $self = shift;
  my $act = (@_ == 1) ? shift : { @_ };

  Carp::croak("Required parameter 'Action' not defined") unless $act->{Action};

  # Check that the connection is open
  unless ($self->{socket}) {
    $self->{error} = "Not connected to Asterisk!";
    return undef;
  }

  # Assemble the message to send to Asterisk
  my $id = $self->{ActionID}++;
  my $message = "ActionID: $id$EOL";

  for my $key (sort keys %$act) {
    if (ref $act->{$key}) {
      $message .= "$key: $_$EOL" for @{ $act->{$key} };
    } else {
      $message .= "$key: $act->{$key}$EOL";
    }
  }

  $message .= $EOL;             # Message ends with blank line

  # If debugging, print out the message before sending it
  if ($self->{Debug_FH}) {
    my $debug = $message;
    $debug =~ s/\r//g;
    $debug =~ s/^/>> /mg;
    print { $self->{Debug_FH} } $debug;
  }

  # Send the request to Asterisk
  unless (print { $self->{socket} } $message) {
    $self->{error} = "Writing to socket failed: $!";
    return undef;
  }

  $id;
} # end send_action
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method-low read_response

  $response = $ami->read_response;

Reads a single message from Asterisk.  Blocks until a message arrives.
The C<action> method waits for the response, so C<read_response>
is only useful for reading events.

It returns a hashref in the same format as the C<%args> for the
C<action> method.

Note that events received by C<read_response> are not delivered to the
C<Event_Callback> (if any).  The callback is used only for events
that are received during the execution of the C<action> method.

If you have not called the C<connect> method (or it failed), calling
C<action> will return a manufactured Error response with Message
"Not connected to Asterisk!" and set C<< $ami->error >>.

If communication with Asterisk fails, it will return a manufactured
Error response with Message "Reading from socket failed: %s" and set
C<< $ami->error >>.

=cut

sub read_response {
  my $self = shift;

  # Check that the connection is open
  my $socket = $self->{socket};
  unless ($socket) {
    return {
      Response => 'Error',
      Message => $self->{error} = "Not connected to Asterisk!",
    };
  }

  # Read a response terminated by a blank line
  local $/ = $EOL;
  my $debug_fh = $self->{Debug_FH};
  my ($line, %response);
  undef $!;

  while ($line = <$socket>) {
    chomp $line;
    print $debug_fh "<< $line\n" if $debug_fh;

    return \%response unless length $line;

    # Remove the key from the "Key: Value" line
    # If the line is not in that format, ignore it.
    $line =~ s/^([^:]+): // or next;

    if (not exists $response{$1}) {
      # First occurrence of this key, save as string
      $response{$1} = $line;
    } elsif (ref $response{$1}) {
      # Third or more occurrence of this key, append to arrayref
      push @{ $response{$1} }, $line;
    } else {
      # Second occurrence of this key, convert to arrayref
      $response{$1} = [ $response{$1}, $line ];
    }
  } # end while reading from $socket

  # There was a communication failure; return an error.
  return {
    Response => 'Error',
    Message => $self->{error} = "Reading from socket failed: $!",
  };
} # end read_response

#---------------------------------------------------------------------

=method-main error

  $error_message = $ami->error;

If communication with Asterisk fails, this method will return an error
message describing the problem.

If Asterisk returns "Response: Error" for some action, that does not
set C<< $ami->error >>.  The exceptions are the automatic Login and Logoff
actions performed by the L</connect> and L</disconnect> methods, which
do set C<error> on failure.

It returns C<undef> if there has been no communication error.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Telephony::Asterisk::AMI ();

  my $ami = Telephony::Asterisk::AMI->new(
    Username => 'user',
    Secret => 'password',
  );

  $ami->connect or die $ami->error;

  my $response = $ami->action(Action => 'Ping');

  $ami->disconnect or die $ami->error;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Telephony::Asterisk::AMI is a simple client for the Asterisk Manager
Interface.  It's better documented and less buggy than
L<Asterisk::Manager>, and has fewer prerequisites than
L<Asterisk::AMI>.  It uses L<IO::Socket::IP>, so it should support
either IPv4 or IPv6.

If you need a more sophisticated client (especially for use in an
event-driven program), try Asterisk::AMI.


=head1 METHODS

=begin Pod::Loom-group_method construct

=head2 Constructor

=begin Pod::Loom-group_method main

=head2 Main Methods

=begin Pod::Loom-group_method low

=head2 Low-Level Methods

You shouldn't normally need to use these methods, but sometimes you
need more control over the communication with Asterisk.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Home>

L<Asterisk::AMI> is a more sophisticated AMI client better suited for
event-driven programs.

If you're using L<POE>, you may want
L<POE::Component::Client::Asterisk::Manager>.
