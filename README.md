Telephony-Asterisk-AMI
======================

Telephony::Asterisk::AMI is a Perl module that provides a simple client for the Asterisk Manager Interface. It's better documented and less buggy than [Asterisk::Manager](https://metacpan.org/pod/Asterisk::Manager), and has fewer prerequisites than [Asterisk::AMI](https://metacpan.org/pod/Asterisk::AMI).

If you need a more sophisticated client (especially for use in an event-driven program), try Asterisk::AMI.

This is a Git repository where development of Telephony-Asterisk-AMI takes place.  For more information, visit [Telephony-Asterisk-AMI on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/Telephony-Asterisk-AMI).
